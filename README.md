Generate random adjective/noun names - http://nc.sourcecomb.com/random-names

Useful for project code-names if you can't think of something fun yet.

Adjectives and nouns are maintained in `words/adjectives.txt` and
 `words/nouns.txt`, respectively. The first set was stolen from
 [weaver/moniker], because they already had a nice collection.
